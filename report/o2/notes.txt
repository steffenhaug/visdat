1.b. there are three triangles here, as you can see from the blue shade in the center is its
     own vertex. the triangles are adjacent to save typing a lot of verts

2.a. crucial that the triangles are drawn back to front

2.b. "back triangles" drawn too late will simply not be blended in at all because they fail
     the depth test

3.b. link vid i guess
     changing b and d (off-diagonal) causes sheering

     changing a and e (on-diagonal) causes scaling along the given axes

     changing c and f appears to move side to side, but gets extremely
     stretched out towards the edge of the screen (kinda fisheye lens effect)

     this distortion made me curious so i computed the determinant of the matrix,
     and it is
        -bd + ea
     and the fact that c and f does not appear in the determinant proves that
     these could have no effect on the area of any triangle, and that the distortion
     effect is simply an optical illusion


3.c. the boring answer is that this is simply not the form of a rotation matrix
     most of the time, and we know this from the theory in the course.
    
     some of the effects we can create with this matrix LOOK LIKE rotations,
     but are simply an optical illusion

     it is actually possible to make a rotation matrix around the Z-axis by letting
         a = cos t, b = -sin t, c = 0, d = sin t, e = cos t, f = 0
     then we will see the scene spin

     but by changing individual values we will never make a rotation matrix
